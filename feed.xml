The library is called Babashka. It runs on the Small Clojure Interpreter and is compiled to native code via GraalVM. There is a self-contained binary thus no JVM installation is required. Runtime performance is not a goal within the project, the startup time is pretty fast though.I used Babashka to create a small script that goes to a sports website and grabs some data from the rendered HTML (using the slurp function). To get the desired elements inside the HTML, I prepared a litte regex. After a few steps of processing I achieved the final output. Below you can find the code of the script and a screenshot of the output in the terminal.</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://matsch.dev/posts/2021-03-10-learning-clojure/</guid><link>https://matsch.dev/posts/2021-03-10-learning-clojure/</link><title>Learning Clojure</title><description>I am currently dabbling in Clojure. In the next few weeks and months I am looking to delve deeper into the language
and try to implement a few smaller projects. One of the more ambitious projects planned is an implementation of the tabletop title
