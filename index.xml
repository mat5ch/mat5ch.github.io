      <description>Melody Helpr Melody Helpr is an app that tries to help with creating melodies from scratch. It is meant to be used in companion with the Open Source recording software Ardour. You can create new melody sequences, double or halve them, recreate at any point and finally transfer the created sequence from Melody Helpr back into Ardour to further work with it.
Find this project at my GitHub.</description>

      <description>Hey there. My name is Matthias. I&amp;rsquo;m a graduate in Media Design (B.A.) and passionate about using web technologies to create art and tools to improve everyday life. I also like to tinker with different programming languages from time to time. Some days, I go out into the woods where I enjoy a relaxed solo walk.</description>
